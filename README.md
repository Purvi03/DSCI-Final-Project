DSCI PROJECT 
Topic : Network Intrusion Detection Analysis
      ( Insights from the KDD Cup 99 Dataset ) 
          

Objective : The problem at hand is to develop a machine learning model for network intrusion detection using the KDD Cup 99 dataset. The dataset is known for its application in the evaluation of models that can detect a wide variety of intrusions manifested in network traffic.


The analysis strategy outlined in the provided code follows a structured machine learning workflow:
1. Data Preprocessing: Initial data exploration, followed by feature scaling and encoding to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
2. Dimensionality Reduction: Application of PCA to reduce feature space while retaining most of the dataset variance.
3. Model Training: Several classification models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained on the transformed data.
4. Model Evaluation: Performance of each model is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine their effectiveness in classifying the data.

This strategy ensures that the data is appropriately prepared, models are carefully selected and trained, and performance is thoroughly evaluated using multiple metrics.
